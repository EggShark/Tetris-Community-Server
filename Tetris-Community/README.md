# Tetris-Community
A Markdown file written to give fast access to resources for new members of the Modern Tetris community

## Release
Main website (Rentry): 
https://rentry.org/tetriscommunity

You can also download latest version of the markdown file in [Releases](https://github.com/Degura/Tetris-Community/releases/)

## Objectives
1. To give a quick and easy, no-fuss overview of the community that is easily understanble for new or potential members.
2. Have a consistent format in order to prevent bias
3. Provide a balanced mix of accuracy and brevity in the curation process to give a fair representation of the Modern Tetris community.

## How to Contribute
If you've never worked on a coding project before, I would recommend [you watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8RSMBSzFuA) on how to make a commit (i.e, propose a change) to the file. 

1. Clone the repository
2. Edit the tetriscommunity.md file
3. Make a commit and the administrators will talk it out with you

## Administrators
The administrators are the people with the current passcode to the Rentry page. Administrators ultimately update the Rentry page. 
Current Admins: 
1. Jed (Github: Degura) (Added 2023/05/03) (Main Admin)
2. Freyhoe (Github: freyhoe) (Added 2023/05/04)

### Apply to become an Administrator
People with a notable reputation in the community or with a streak of good contributions to the project can apply to become an administrator. Send your community member name (Discord, Github, other pertinent sites) and a brief (100 word max) explanation as to why you should be an administrator.
